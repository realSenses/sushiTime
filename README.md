This sushi tool was built using  MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars a homemade ORM and love (with the ocassional beer thrown in the mix). This MVC pattern app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars as a templating engine.

# Why sushi time? And what does it...do?
Sushi Time was originally a slightly less serious idea that arose during the summer of 2018 at a conveyor belt sushi restauraunt in Seattle. I had just finished eating my fill of delectable fish, and was left staring at the mountain of discarded colored plates in front of me. Each colored plate told me the price of the roll that had been resting on it...but not which rolls I'd eaten. What to do? "If only I had a way to keep track of the sushi I ate!" I thought as I paid the bill trying to remember if I'd gotten 2 or 3 spicy salmon rolls. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I had the idea to use a database and mySQL to handle the task. Sushi Time is the result. Next time, I'll come prepared!
